        <p>
            There could be cross-browser issues while using CSS What works for one browser may not necessarily work for   others. This might cause compatibility issues.
            There are multiple levels of CSS such as CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3. This can create confusion for non-developers and beginners.
            Lack of security is one of the major disadvantages of the Cascading style sheet. It is vulnerable to being injected with malicious code like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
            CSS has limited control over layouts. In order to achieve certain specific layout details like adding multiple columns to the table, other tools like Flexbox or Grid need to be used.

            what do you understand by CSS Opacity?
        </li>
        <p>
            The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.
        </p>
        <li>
            how can the background color of an element be changed?
        </li>
        <p>
            To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag
        </p>
        <li>
            How can the image reptition of the backup be controlled?
        </li>
        <p>
            This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.
        </p>
        <li>
            What is the use of the background position property?
        </li>
        <p>
            The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.
        </p>
        <li>
            Which property controls the image scroll int he background?
        </li>
        <p>
            The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image will scroll along with the rest of the elements on the page when the user slides the scroll-bar in the browser or whether the image will stay fixed to the page. The background-attachment property can either be set to scroll or fixed.
        </p>
        <li>
            Why should background and color be used as separate properties?
        </li>
        <p>
            There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.

            How to maintain the css specifications
        </li>
        <p>
            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Even though every browser supports CSS, there are many inconsistencies in the supported specification version. Some browsers even have their own implementation of the specification and have proprietary (vendor) prefixes.
        </p>
        <li>what are the ways to integrate css as a web page</li>
        <p>
            CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
            Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
            Internal - by using a style element in the head section.
            External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
        </p>
        <li>
            What is embedded style sheets?
        </li>
        <p>
            An embedded style sheet is declared within the element of an XHTML document. It applies to the whole document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.
        </p>
        <li>
            What are the external style sheets?
        </li>
        <p>
            An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.
        </p>
        <li>
            What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
        </li>
        <p>
            Advantages : one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages
                         you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements
                         consistent look and feel across multiple web pages
                         improved load times because the css file is downloaded once and applied to each relevant page as   needed
        </p>
        <p>
            Disadvanges : 
                        Additional HTTP request: An external style sheet requires an additional HTTP request to load, w Which can slightly increase the time it takes for the page to render.
                        Limited control: With an external style sheet, you have less control over the specific elements on a page, as the styles are applied globally to all elements that use the same class or ID.
                        Harder to override: It can be harder to override the styles in an external style sheet, as they are applied globally. To override a style, you need to use more specific selectors or use the !important declaration, which can make your style sheet more complex and difficult to maintain.
        </p>
        <li>
            What is the meaning of the CSS selector
        </li>
        <p>
            A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
        </p>
        <li>
            What are the media type allowed by CSS
        </li>
        <p>
            Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones). 
        </p>
        <li>
            What is the rule set?
        </li>
        <p>
            A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and one or more declarations. The selector(s), which in this example is h1 , points to an HTML element. The declaration(s), which in this example are color: blue and text-align: center style the element with a property and value.
